## Upgrading node version on your system
1. Clone the project to your machine and run the below command
`sudo ./installer/install-node.sh`
This will install the node version 6

`./installer/config-npm.sh`
This for configuring your npm so that you don't need to use sudo ever again!

2. Run `npm install`
It will install all the dependencies required.

3. Run `npm test` to run your test cases.

4. Run `npm run dev` to run your local dev server.
